ODAC Shows Documentation
=======================================

ODAC Shows helps with keeping on track of TV and On Demand shows you are currently watching. 

This project is currently in very early days! I've used this internally for around a year and have been improving it since. I've found it so useful, that I'm now embarking on making it my first "proper" open source project.

Look how easy it is to use:

What can it do?

- Track your chosen live shows using a live TV guide. It will search each day to see what's on and give you good notification of a show being on as well as the timeslot it's on during
- Track your chosen on demand shows. More of a manual tracking requirement but allows for circumnavigating the issues with shows being removed and re-added with the progress wiped (looking at you NOWTV).
